        "#Answer-Measures of central tendency are ways to find the \"center\" or most typical value in a set of data. The three main measures are mean, median, and mode. Here’s a breakdown of each and when it’s best to use them:\n",
        "#Mean;\n",
        "#The mean is the average of all values in a dataset. You calculate it by adding up all the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are.\n",
        "#Formula: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)\n",
        "#When to Use the Mean: Use the mean when data has no extreme values (or outliers) because it takes all values into account. It works well for data that is symmetrically distributed (meaning it doesn’t have extreme highs or lows that could skew the average).\n",
        "#Example Scenario: If you want to find the average score of a class on a test where most scores are close together, the mean would be a good measure\n",
        "\n",
        "#Median (Middle Value)\n",
        "#The median is the middle value in an ordered list. To find it, you sort the numbers from lowest to highest and select the middle one. If there’s an even number of values, you take the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "#Example: For the numbers 3, 1, 7, 8, and 10, when sorted (1, 3, 7, 8, 10), the median is 7.\n",
        "#When to Use the Median: Use the median when data has outliers or extreme values. The median isn’t affected by unusually high or low values, so it provides a more typical middle for skewed data.\n",
        "#Example Scenario: For household income in a neighborhood where a few residents earn much more than others, the median income gives a better idea of the \"typical\" income because it’s less affected by the high earners.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Mode (Most Frequent Value)\n",
        "#The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. There can be more than one mode if multiple values have the same highest frequency.\n",
        "#Example: For the numbers 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, the mode is 2 because it appears most often.\n",
        "#When to Use the Mode: Use the mode when data has repeated values or when you want to identify the most common item. It’s especially useful for categorical data (data in categories, like colors or types).\n",

        "#Answer- Dispersion is a way of describing how spread out or close together the values in a dataset are. If the values are tightly grouped around the center, the dispersion is low. If the values are scattered far from the center, the dispersion is high.\n",
        "#Two common ways to measure this spread are variance and standard deviation. Both help us see how much the values differ from the average (mean), but they do it in slightly different ways:\n",
        "#1. Variance\n",
        "#Variance measures the average of how far each value is from the mean, but it squares these differences to make sure they're all positive and to emphasize larger gaps.\n",
        "# Think of it as a way to show the “average distance squared” from the mean.\n",
        "# Simple Example: Imagine you have test scores, and most of them are around the class average of 75, with just a few scores far off. The variance would take each score’s distance from 75, square it, and then find the average of these squared distances. A higher variance means scores are more spread out.\n",
        "# 2. Standard Deviation\n",
        "# Standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, which brings the measurement back to the original units (like points, dollars, or centimeters).\n",
        "# This makes it easier to interpret because it tells you, on average, how far each value is from the mean.\n",
        "# Simple Example: If the test scores have a standard deviation of 5, that means most scores are within 5 points of the average score of 75. A standard deviation of 20, however, would mean scores are much more spread out.\n",

        "# Both variance and standard deviation give us a sense of how much the data varies.\n",

        "# Spread: The length of the box shows how spread out the middle half of the data is. A longer box means more variation; a shorter box means less.\n",

        "# If the median line is in the center of the box, the data is balanced.\n",
